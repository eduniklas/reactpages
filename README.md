# Labb2.React

# About the task:

This task builds upon Lab 1, and in this one, you will further develop your CV page to include JavaScript and make it more dynamic.

# What you need to do:

You should continue building on your CV page from Lab 1, and now ensure that it also meets the following requirements:

**CV in a File**

This part should be built with pure JavaScript.

- [ ] Your education and previous workplaces should no longer be in the HTML code.
- [ ] The education you've attended and your previous jobs should be in a separate JSON-format file.
- [ ] This JSON file should be read and used to generate your CV.

**Easter Eggs**

This part should be built with pure JavaScript.

- [ ] You should create two Easter eggs on your website that visitors should be able to find.
- [ ] One of your Easter eggs should be activated when the user clicks on an "odd" part of the website that they typically wouldn't click on. When this part is clicked, the background of the website should change.
- [ ] Your second Easter egg should be activated when the user types a combination on the keyboard, such as "1337". When the user enters this combination on the keyboard, a fun message should appear in a modal popup.

**Portfolio**

This part should be built with React.

- [ ] Your portfolio should be expanded to fetch public projects from your own GitHub. It should display these projects in your portfolio with their names and descriptions.
    
    You can have both these projects and the previous ones that are directly in the HTML code if you want. Or you can replace the previous projects so that only your GitHub projects are displayed.
    
- [ ] When the projects are being fetched, there should be information indicating that the projects are loading so that the visitor doesn't wonder why the page is initially empty.

**VG-kriterier**

If you aim for an higher grade on this task and in the course, you should pay extra attention to how you implement React. The better the implementation, the greater the chance of achieving an VG.

You should also incorporate the following:

- [ ] The navigation on the page should be based on React Router so that the entire page effectively runs React. However, most of the content loaded on most pages can be pure HTML and does not need to be fetched as JSON, for example.
